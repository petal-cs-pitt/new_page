summary: "Response-to-Text Tasks to Assess Students' Use of Evidence and Organization in Writing: Using Natural Language Processing for Scoring Writing and Providing Feedback At-Scale ( 2016 - 2025)
"

abstract: "Our project studies the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to score students' argument writing and provide automated feedback to students to strengthen their essays. We have recently expanded our project to focus on automated assessment of students' revision efforts with feedback to develop their revision skills. Our work has been funded by the National Science Foundations, the Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences, and the Learning Research & Development Center at University of Pittsburgh. A summary of some of our research contributions is provided in the [research brief](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RBA1062-1.html) published by the RAND Corporation."
