abstract: "We propose an approach for the structure controllable summarization of long legal opinions
that considers the argument structure of the document. Our approach involves using predicted
argument role information to guide the model
in generating coherent summaries that follow a
provided structure pattern. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on a dataset of
legal opinions and show that it outperforms several strong baselines with respect to ROUGE,
BERTScore, and structure similarity."
