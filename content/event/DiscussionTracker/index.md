summary: "Discussion Tracker: Development of Human Language Technologies to Improve the Teaching of Collaborative Argumentation in High School English Classrooms (September 2018 - September 2022)
"

abstract: "Collaborative argumentation, or the building of evidence-based, reasoned knowledge and solutions through dialogue, is essential to individual learning as well as group problem-solving. Student-centered discussions and elaborated student talk during collaborative argumentation are indicators of robust learning opportunities in STEM and other disciplines. Furthermore, the ability to engage in collaborative problem-solving is a foundational skill in STEM fields and a defining characteristic of 21st century workplaces, especially those in the technology and engineering fields, and a skill that employers report that few recent hires possess. However, teaching collaborative argumentation is an advanced skill that many high school teachers struggle to develop. We aim to develop an innovative technology called Discussion Tracker, a web-based system that leverages recent advances in human language technologies (HLT) to provide teachers with automatically generated data about the quality of students? collaborative argumentation in their classrooms and to support teachers' learning about collaborative argumentation."
