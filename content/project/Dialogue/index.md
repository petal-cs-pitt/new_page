summary: "Designing Effective Dialogue, Gaze, and Gesture Behaviors in a Social Robot that Supports Collaborative Learning in Middle School Mathematics (October 2020 - September 2023) (extends Studying Collaborative Dialogue with a Teachable Robot in a Mathematics Domain (July 2019 - June 2021))
"

abstract: "In this project, we are interested in positioning the robot as a tutee that one or more human learners teach about a subject domain using spoken dialogue. This project proposes to build on existing learning sciences work within the exciting research spaces of teachable agents, human-robot interaction, spoken dialogue interaction, and collaborative learning, by examining a more complex scenario: multiple students collaborate with a robot through spoken interaction."
